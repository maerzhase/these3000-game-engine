# Flappy

This is a clone of Flappy Bird made for desktop platforms, for a video tutorial on YouTube which you can find [here](http://youtu.be/527bR2JHSR0). This video shows the narrated creation of this game from scratch, in about 3 hours including short explanations of what is being typed, and why.

### Dependencies
* `LWJGL 3` : Light Weight Java Game Library 3, which you can download [here](http://www.lwjgl.org/download). You'll have to manually add the JAR and native files to your classpath in order to build and run the game.
